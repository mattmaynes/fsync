# fsync
fysnc allows you to keep two directories synchronized either locally or remotely. It is a simple wrapper around `fswatch` that uses `rsync` to keep files in different places synchronized every time there is a change. 

## Installation
To run fsync you need to install rsync and fswatch. Once installed simply invoke fsync on any directory.

## To Do
- Add support for watching specific files
- Add support for running in background
- Add support for logging to file
